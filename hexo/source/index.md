[Hello](https://youtu.be/qcCuFLbWznY),

On [Philippe Ivaldi](/about/)'s blog, a complete rewrite of the [old www.piprime.fr](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127161709/http://www.piprime.fr/),
you'll find posts or in-depth articles (or not) on what intrigues me, fascinates me, or horrifies me; in short,
everything that nourishes me, excites me, and simply makes me live.

The topics covered are classified by [categories](/categories/) and subcategories, with two clearly differentiated
main themes:
- [Technical](/categories/tech/): **purely technical** considerations, particularly in **IT**, one of my favorite fields;
- [Non-technical](/categories/non-tech/): publications that are not purely technical; these can be **reflections** (political,
  philosophical, spiritual, etc.) as well as cooking recipes, **notes** on things to
  read/watch/listen, **book reviews**, or more personal **slices of life**.

Each article has one or more tags that allow for more precise classification and increase the
granularity of the categorization with crossing subject. The list of tags is accessible on [this page](/tags/).

All the links for navigating this site are in the left column:

- In the top box, there are links to specific pages, such as the paginated [list of all articles](/posts/) or
  the page dedicated to the [Asymptote software](/asymptote/), for which I once worked extensively. There is also
  access to an internal search engine.
- In the bottom box, you will find either links to social networks and the posts/categories/labels
  pages, or the table of contents for the current page, depending on whether or not there are titles
  and subtitles on the page.

Finally, this site is supposed to be bilingual (French/English), but I admit that I sometimes feel
really lazy about translating an article I wrote in French into another language (or vice versa);
especially since I'm not very good at English...  
Don't hesitate to contact me to suggest a translation, a correction, or anything else you deem important.
