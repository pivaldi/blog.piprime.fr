Passionate about computers since the age of 14, I wrote my first programs on a personal computer
[TI 99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A), then in high school on [SIL'Z](/media/about/silz.jpg) from
[LEANORD](http://www.ti99.com/exelvision/website/index.php?page=leanord-sil-z-16) and on a
[Micral 80/22](https://www.micral.fr/micral/bull-micral.html) from [Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_Bull).  
Now I'm a die-hard fan of [Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo) [Thinkpads](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/c/laptops/thinkpad/),
which allow you to [run Linux out of the box](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki).

After studying mathematics, I taught for 17 years in the national education system as a [certified teacher](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professeur_certifi%C3%A9).
Then I decided to turn my passion into my career and am currently the technical director of the IT system for an SME.

Paradoxically, I live far from everything, surrounded by nature, on an old farm that I restored with the idea of ​​moving towards food and even energy self-sufficiency.

Particularly attached to the spirit of sharing inspired by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman),
the instigator of the concept of [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software),
all the IT solutions I use, whether for personal or professional use, are based on open source
solutions that offer quality, respect for users, and [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_file_format).

Beyond the economic and technical aspects of open source solutions, I am particularly sensitive to
privacy and I believe in the future of human development by humanity and for humanity, not through
the purely commercial visions of large multinationals that work only for their own interests and
those of their shareholders with the sole aim of endless enrichment with disregard for users,
fundamental rights, and the environment.
