Hi, my name is Philippe IVALDI and I live near
[Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne) in the south of France.

Passionate about computer science since the age of 14, I still studied mathematics fourth year of
university and then obtained the diploma of certified teacher in mathematics…

After teaching for 15 years in French national education I decided to make my passion my job.  
In 2007, I converted to IT and quickly became technical director of the IT system for the Renée
Costes group, one of the main activities of which is [the sale of property en life annuity](https://www.costes-viager.com/).
The entire IT system was taken over from scratch as well as the development of a tailor-made business solution for
the group with a team of 3 engineers and two technicians.

Particularly attached to the spirit of sharing instilled by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), instigator of the
concept of [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), all the solutions that I
use, whether for personal or professional use, are based on [open soure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model)
solutions that offer the both quality, respect for users and [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format).

Beyond the purely economic aspect of free solutions I believe in the future of a development of
humanity by humanity and for humanity, not by the purely mercantile visions of large multinationals
which work only for their own interests in order to enrich themselves endlessly sometimes with the
contempt of the users.
