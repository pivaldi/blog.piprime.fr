## My privacy is important, not because my actions are questionable, but because your judgment and your intentions are.

The phrase **"If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"** is often used in debates
about surveillance or privacy; for example, the charismatic and charming
[Klaus Schwab](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schwab) used it in
[this now famous interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcey1PPiIM&t=477s),
which will not surprise those who know this fine man.

On the surface, the phrase seems logical: if your actions are legal and honest, why worry about being watched?
But in reality, it is misleading and dangerous in several ways:

1. **It assumes that only guilty people need privacy**  
   Yet everyone has things to protect: personal conversations, medical data,
   financial information, political opinions… Even if they are not illegal, they can be
   misinterpreted or used against you.
1. **It ignores the problem of power and abuse**  
   Giving unlimited access to your data means trusting 100% those who hold it—
   today and in the future. A political change or authoritarian drift can turn
   harmless data into "incriminating" evidence.
1. **It shifts the burden of proof**  
   In a state of law, it is up to the authority to justify why it is investigating, not to the individual to
   prove their innocence.
1. **It denies freedom of thought and expression**  
   Knowing that one is being watched changes our behavior (it is the "panopticon effect"), and
   reduces our real freedom even if we have "nothing to hide".

**This phrase is therefore a simplistic slogan that serves to justify mass surveillance to the detriment of individual freedoms**.
