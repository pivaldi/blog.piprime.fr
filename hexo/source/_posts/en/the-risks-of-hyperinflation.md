## The Risks of Hyperinflation

Hyperinflation is an extreme form of inflation, generally defined as a rapid and uncontrolled increase in prices at a rate higher than **50% per month**. It leads to severe **economic**, **social**, and **political** consequences.

### Economic Risks

- **Loss of currency value:**  
  The national currency becomes almost worthless, pushing people to use foreign currencies or tangible goods as a medium of exchange.
- **Drop in consumption and investment:**  
  Uncertainty drives households to spend quickly and businesses to avoid investments.
- **Collapse of the financial system:**  
  Banks lose the trust of depositors, and credit becomes inaccessible.
- **Disruption of domestic trade:**  
  Prices constantly change, making business management extremely difficult.
- **Capital flight and dollarization of the economy:**  
  People convert their savings into foreign currencies and send them abroad.

### Social Risks

- **Impoverishment of the population:**  
  Real incomes fall, especially for employees and retirees.
- **Increased inequalities:**  
  Those who own tangible assets or foreign currencies fare better.
- **Growth of the informal economy:**  
  Barter and the black market become alternatives to the official system.

### Political Risks

- **Political instability:**  
  Protests, riots, increased social crises.
- **Rise of authoritarian regimes:**  
  Populist or authoritarian governments may emerge by promising stability and price control.

### Historical Examples of Hyperinflation

- **Germany (1923)**
- **Zimbabwe (2000s)**
- **Venezuela (2010s)**
- **Hungary (1945â€“1946)**, the worst recorded case
