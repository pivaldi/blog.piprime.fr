## Some egg substitutes

Some egg substitutes to use in recipes to bind ingredients together:  
- 2 tbsp cornstarch = 1 egg  
- 2 tbsp potato starch = 1 egg  
- 1 tbsp soy flour + 2 tbsp water = 1 egg  
- 1 tbsp soy milk powder + 1 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water = 1 egg  
- 2 tsp corn flour + 2 tsp water = 1 egg (for baked preparations).  
- In cakes:
  - 1 small mashed banana.  
  - The following mixture can also be used: potato starch + tapioca flour +
    leavening agents. Tapioca alone is a good binder, as is agar-agar.

## Pie or Tourte Dough

**Ingredients:**
- 500g type 65 or 45 flour;
- 250g vegan margarine;
- 0.15 of water in a graduated glass or 1.5 mustard glasses.

**Preparation:**  
Put the flour in a bowl.  
Cut the margarine into small pieces over the flour.  
Using a long knife, chop the mixture to start mixing.  
When the margarine is in smaller pieces, crumble with your hands, leaving some large lumps like peas.  
Start adding the water little by little, knead by hand, first coarsely, then more finely, splitting the moistened dough in two to avoid hand fatigue, then bringing the two pieces together and kneading thoroughly until it no longer sticks and is supple.  
Let the dough rest in a bowl, covered with a cloth, at least 30 minutes before use.  
Preheat oven: 10 minutes at 225°C / 250°C (th. 6).  
Baking time: 25 to 30 minutes at 210°C / 225°C (th. 5) depending on the amount of fruit.

This dough keeps perfectly in the fridge for about a week, floured and in a dry place; bring to room temperature to make it pliable under the rolling pin.

## Puff Pastry

**Ingredients:**
- 200g flour;
- 150g vegan margarine;
- 2 to 3 tsp brown sugar (if using for a sweet dish; otherwise, omit);
- salt;
- water.

**Preparation:**  
Pour the flour into a mixing bowl (with the sugar if using), a pinch of salt, and 10cl cold water.  
Mix into a homogeneous, smooth dough.  
Weigh this dough to know the exact weight of fat to add: half the weight of the dough.  
Let rest 20 minutes in the fridge. For good puff pastry, several things are important:  
1) The margarine must be the same consistency as the dough, neither harder nor softer.  
2) All utensils (including hands) should be very cold.

Flour the work surface and roll the dough into a thick rectangle.  
Place the margarine in one block in the center.  
Fold the edges of the dough over to enclose the margarine.  
Roll out into a new rectangle. Fold into thirds, first the bottom third up, then the top third down.  
Turn the dough a quarter turn to the right.  
Give the second turn: roll out into a rectangle, fold as before, and turn a quarter turn.  
Let rest 20 minutes in the fridge.  
Repeat this operation twice more (classic puff pastry is 6 turns, i.e., 3 sets of 2 turns with resting after every 2 turns).
