## Context and Objective

The document analyzes the distributional consequences of a scenario in which the price of Bitcoin
continues to rise over time. Contrary to Satoshi Nakamoto’s (2008) initial promise to create a
better global means of payment, Bitcoin is today mainly considered a speculative investment asset.
The authors focus on the macroeconomic and redistributive impacts of a “positive” scenario for
Bitcoin, i.e. a continuous price increase.

*Counterpoint:  
It is inaccurate to claim that Nakamoto’s promise has not been fulfilled: Bitcoin has already revolutionized the notion of [independent digital money](https://bitcoin.org/en/), offering an alternative to centralized systems.  
Even though the use as a universal medium of payment is progressing slowly, the role of [store of
value](https://www.kraken.com/en/learn/finance/store-of-value) and [protection against global
monetary devaluation is at the core of the Bitcoin
innovation](https://www.paymium.com/blog/comment-inflation-ronge-epargne) (in French). Speculative
investment is not a diversion, but a phase in the adoption of disruptive technology. Network effects
and volatility are typical for the early stages of any new asset class.*

## Bitcoin: Uses, Valuation, and Investment Narrative

- **Limited real-world usage**: Bitcoin has never been widely adopted for legal payments, even in
  countries that have recognized it as an official currency (e.g., El Salvador).

*Counterpoint:  
Adoption of a new currency takes time, especially when facing competition from national currencies, regulation, and institutional mistrust.  
The El Salvador example is caricatural: infrastructure, education, and political resistance are obstacles, but the technical possibility exists and progress is real, especially for remittances and in [underbanked countries](https://www.paymium.com/blog/comment-bitcoin-peut-il-beneficier-aux-pays-en-developpement) (in French).  
Moreover, Bitcoin is already used to [bypass financial
censorship](/en/why-bitcoin-is-popular-in-dictatorships/) and [protect
privacy](https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy), which is a fundamental use case.*

- **Valuation issue**: Unlike traditional assets (stocks, bonds, real estate), Bitcoin generates no
  cash flow, making any “fundamental” valuation impossible.

*Counterpoint:  
The absence of cash flow does not preclude value, as gold has demonstrated for millennia.  
Bitcoin derives its value from the [security of the BTC
network](https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/can-a-cryptocurrency-like-bitcoin-be-hacked/),
its absolute scarcity (21 million units), its portability, and its unalterable nature. Traditional
valuation models are ill-suited for an emerging monetary asset. The demand for an apolitical and
non-inflationary asset justifies a “monetary premium” independent of [cash
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow).*

- **Investment narrative**: Increasingly, public figures and investors (Larry Fink, Cathie Wood,
  Michael Saylor…) defend Bitcoin as “digital gold”, betting on its limited supply and growing
  demand, but without connection to real economic utility.

*Counterpoint:  
Bitcoin’s economic utility goes far beyond mere speculation: it offers [protection against confiscation](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-is-censorship-resistance/), [hyperinflation](/en/the-risks-of-hyperinflation/), and enables international transfers without intermediaries.  
The comparison with gold is indeed relevant, but Bitcoin surpasses gold in divisibility,
portability, and transparency. Furthermore, growing institutional demand shows that sophisticated
actors see macroeconomic and strategic utility in holding Bitcoin.*

## Macroeconomic Implications of Asset Bubbles

- The authors distinguish cases where an asset’s value rise is accompanied by increased productivity
  (technological innovation), from those that only reflect a speculative bubble.

*Counterpoint:  
Innovation is not always measurable by immediate productivity gains.  
Bitcoin innovates in trust, monetary sovereignty, and digital security—factors that do not directly
show up in traditional productivity statistics but have a profound societal impact. The analogy to a
bubble neglects the creation of a new global economic ecosystem.*

- In the case of Bitcoin, the value increase is not accompanied by any increase in the productive
  potential of the economy: thus, it is “wealth” creation that does not correspond to real wealth
  creation.

*Counterpoint:  
Economic “productive potential” is not the only progress criterion.  
Bitcoin improves global access to store of value, lowers international transfer costs, secures
savings from sovereign risks, and stimulates the development of alternative financial services
(DeFi, Lightning Network, etc.). These effects are real, even if not reflected in traditional GDP.*

- Central banks, in such a scenario, could limit the inflationary effect by tightening monetary
  policy, but this does not compensate for the redistributive aspect.

*Counterpoint:  
Inflationary effects are a result of money printing, not Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin acts as a thermometer, revealing the loss of purchasing power in fiat currencies, and offers
an alternative that encourages central banks to act more responsibly. Moreover, redistribution
linked to Bitcoin is voluntary: no one is forced to buy or sell.*

## Distributional Consequences of a Bullish Bitcoin

- **Enrichment effect**: Early holders (“early birds”) fully benefit from the price increase,
  selling gradually to “latecomers”.

*Counterpoint:  
This is true for any emerging asset: initial risk is rewarded. Early birds assumed enormous technological, legal, and reputational risks.  
Moreover, Bitcoin’s distribution is broader and more transparent than traditional monetary issuance,
which often benefits those closest to central banks (the “Cantillon Effect”).*

- **Impoverishment effect**: This increased consumption by early holders necessarily comes at the
  expense of the rest of society, whose consumption or savings are compressed, since the “wealth”
  created by Bitcoin does not increase real production.

*Counterpoint:  
There is no “zero-sum” game here: Bitcoin’s rise results from a voluntary transfer of savings to an asset considered safer or more promising.  
Those who choose not to participate are not impoverished, unless their currency is devalued, which
is the result of inflationary monetary policies. Bitcoin offers protection against such
devaluation.*

- **Simulation**: A simple model shows that, even without a bubble bursting, a continuous price rise
  generates a lasting transfer of wealth from new entrants and non-holders to early investors.

*Counterpoint:  
Models are reductive: in reality, adoption creates value for all users, as with any network technology.  
Moreover, Bitcoin’s distribution widens over time, and the incentive to join early rewards
initiative. Latecomers benefit from a more secure, liquid, and user-friendly network.*

- **Impact on social cohesion**: These redistributive effects could increase inequality and social
  division, without any overall economic benefit.

*Counterpoint:  
Bitcoin offers everyone, without discrimination, the possibility to access an open, neutral financial system.  
It reduces dependence on failing states and empowers individuals. Inequality often stems from
differences in access to information and willingness to take risks: Bitcoin democratizes this
access.*

## The Role of Politics and Regulators

- Bitcoin’s fate depends heavily on the political and regulatory context: ETF approvals, legal
  recognition, active crypto industry lobbying, and its weight in US electoral debates.

*Counterpoint:  
Despite regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin has withstood all attempts at obstruction for 15 years.  
Its [decentralized
nature](https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/what-is-decentralization-in-cryptocurrencies/)
ensures resilience. Institutional and political interest shows the sector’s maturity. The emergence
of a democratic debate around Bitcoin is evidence of its relevance, not a weakness.*

- The authors argue that pro-Bitcoin policies favor redistribution toward early adopters, to the
  detriment of non-holders and late entrants.

*Counterpoint:  
On the contrary, pro-Bitcoin policies promote financial inclusion, competition, and individual
freedom. Those who become informed and act early are rightly rewarded; those who delay or refuse
adoption can still participate at any time, on equal terms, with no entry barriers. Traditional
monetary redistribution is opaque and favors system insiders.*

## Conclusion

- Even in a scenario where the Bitcoin bubble never “bursts,” a continuous price increase inevitably
  results in a redistribution of wealth and purchasing power to early holders, at the expense of the
  rest of society, without creating economic value.

*Counterpoint:  
Economic value creation is not limited to material production: Bitcoin creates value by securing
savings, granting access to monetary freedom, and stimulating financial innovation. Early adopters
took significant risks and helped build a global ecosystem; their reward is not an injustice, but
the natural consequence of radical innovation.*

- Bitcoin promoters as an investment neglect or hide this redistributive effect.

*Counterpoint:  
Redistribution is inherent to all innovation (internet, mobile, etc.) and is neither hidden nor
immoral. It encourages risk-taking, curiosity, and self-education—virtues, not vices.*

- According to the authors, this phenomenon could undermine social cohesion and democracy if
  policymakers ignore the fundamentally redistributive nature of Bitcoin’s price rise.

*Counterpoint:  
Bitcoin is a tool for emancipation and cohesion, especially in contexts of financial repression,
hyperinflation, or political instability. It allows anyone to participate in a fair, open system,
free from discrimination of origin, gender, or status. It strengthens democracy by reducing state
power over money.*
