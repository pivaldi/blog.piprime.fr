**Open metaverse** ([Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)) and **closed metaverse** ([Meta Horizon Worlds](https://horizon.meta.com/)) compared specifically.

## Governance in Open metaverse

How decisions about the platform are made in Decentraland (DAO-led governance).

### Who decides?

Primarily the community, via Decentraland’s **DAO** (decentralized autonomous organization). Voting power is tied to on-chain assets (e.g., MANA, LAND, Names). ([decentraland.org][1])

### How decisions are made (mechanism)

* **Proposals + voting**  
  Community members submit proposals and vote through Decentraland’s governance system; voting is designed to be *gasless/off-chain* (Snapshot/IPFS) for accessibility. ([docs.decentraland.org][2])
* **Binding vs non-binding**  
  Some votes are “signaling” (community sentiment), while others are **binding actions** that—if approved—trigger changes such as smart-contract updates or DAO-controlled records/contracts. ([docs.decentraland.org][3])
* **Execution layer (committee)**  
  Approved binding outcomes are typically enacted on-chain via a **multi-sig** controlled by a “DAO Committee,” meaning execution is delegated even if the decision is community-made. ([docs.decentraland.org][4])

### Practical implications

Governance is comparatively **transparent and participatory** (proposals/votes/results are recorded), but influence can concentrate among large holders because voting power is asset-weighted. ([ScholarSpace][5])

## Governance in Closed metaverse

How decisions about the platform are made in Meta Horizon Worlds (company-led governance).

### Who decides?

Meta (the company)—through its **management and internal product/policy teams**, under corporate governance structures (board + executives). Users don’t get formal voting rights over platform rules or roadmap. ([Meta][6])

### How decisions are made (mechanism)

* **Top-down product governance**  
  Meta sets product direction (features, tooling, availability) and can change course as business priorities evolve; creators/community feedback may influence decisions, but it’s advisory rather than binding. (Corporate governance resides with board/management.) ([Meta][6])
* **Rule-setting + enforcement**  
  Meta defines behavioral and safety rules and enforces them through restriction/suspension/disablement processes when users violate policies. ([About Facebook][7])
* **Limited accountability hooks**  
Meta publishes transparency reporting on enforcement (at least at the broader platform-policy level) and has processes like reporting and (in some cases) appeals—but these remain **Meta-controlled**, not community-governed. ([About Facebook][7])

### Practical implications

Governance is **centralized**: decisions can be faster and more consistent with company strategy, but users have **less formal power** and must rely on Meta’s policy/process choices for accountability.

Below is a **side-by-side comparison of economic models** for an **open metaverse (Decentraland)** and a **closed metaverse (Meta Horizon Worlds)**, focusing on **how each platform generates revenue and how participants are rewarded**.

## Economic Models in Open metaverse

### How the platform generates revenue

Decentraland itself does **not operate like a traditional company extracting profits**. Instead, value flows through the ecosystem:
* **Token economy (MANA)**
  * MANA is used for transactions (land, wearables, names, services).
  * When certain assets are created or registered, MANA may be **burned**, indirectly supporting token value rather than generating corporate revenue.
* **Primary land sales (historical)**  
  Initial LAND auctions generated funds for ecosystem development (now largely complete).
* **Marketplace fees**
  Small fees on secondary-market transactions (e.g., wearables) go to the **DAO treasury**, not a private company.

Revenue is **collectivized** and managed by the DAO rather than captured by a firm.

### How participants are rewarded

Participants can earn value in **multiple, permissionless ways**:
* **Creators & builders**
  * Sell wearables, experiences, event tickets, services
  * Monetize LAND via rentals, advertising, brand activations
* **LAND owners**
  * Capture scarcity-driven value as LAND appreciates
  * Earn passive income from leasing or hosting events
* **Community contributors**  
  Grants from the DAO treasury for development, events, or tools
* **Speculators / users**  
  Potential appreciation of MANA and LAND

Rewards are **market-driven** and **ownership-based**: users directly own assets and keep most of the upside.

### Economic incentives

* Strong incentives for **early adoption and entrepreneurship**
* High upside, but **high volatility**
* Income is not guaranteed; depends on demand and ecosystem health

## Economic Models in Closed metaverse

### How the platform generates revenue

Horizon Worlds follows a **platform-as-a-service** model typical of Big Tech:
* **Platform fees on transactions**  
  Meta takes a **large cut** from sales of virtual goods and experiences (similar to app stores).
* **Advertising (long-term strategy)**  
  Monetization through branded experiences, sponsored spaces, or immersive ads.
* **Hardware ecosystem**  
  Indirect revenue via sales of Meta Quest headsets, which Horizon Worlds helps justify.
* **Data & ecosystem lock-in**  
  User engagement feeds Meta’s broader ecosystem value (even if Horizon Worlds itself is not yet highly profitable).

Revenue is **centralized and captured by Meta**.

### How participants are rewarded

Participants earn value **within Meta’s rules**:
* **Creators**
  * Sell virtual items or experiences
  * Participate in creator incentive programs and bonuses set by Meta
* **Users** may earn cosmetic items, status, or limited virtual currency
* **No true ownership**
  * Assets cannot be freely traded outside Meta’s ecosystem
  * Meta can change monetization terms or revoke access

Rewards are **permissioned**, **revocable**, and **platform-dependent**.

### Economic incentives (summary)

* Lower risk for creators (clear rules, stable infrastructure)
* Lower upside (high platform fees, no asset appreciation)
* Economic power remains with the platform owner

### Direct comparison

| Dimension            | Decentraland (Open)           | Horizon Worlds (Closed)        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Revenue capture      | DAO / ecosystem               | Meta (company)                 |
| Core currency        | MANA (crypto)                 | Proprietary virtual currencies |
| Asset ownership      | Users truly own assets (NFTs) | Assets licensed, not owned     |
| Creator monetization | Market-based, peer-to-peer    | Platform-controlled            |
| Platform fees        | Relatively low, DAO-governed  | High, Meta-defined             |
| Economic upside      | High but volatile             | Lower but more predictable     |
| Rule changes         | Via DAO governance            | Unilateral (Meta decision)     |

Below is a focused comparison of interoperability for an open metaverse (Decentraland) and a closed metaverse (Meta Horizon Worlds)—that is, how well each platform connects with other systems, platforms, and ecosystems.

## Interoperability on Open Metaverse

### Core interoperability model

Decentraland is built on **open blockchain standards**, which makes interoperability a **foundational design principle**, not an add-on.

### How it connects with other systems

1. **Asset interoperability**
* Assets (LAND, wearables, names) are **NFTs on public blockchains**.
* They can be:
  * Viewed, traded, or stored in external wallets (e.g., MetaMask)
  * Listed on third-party marketplaces
  * Potentially reused in *other compatible virtual worlds* or applications
* Ownership exists **outside Decentraland’s servers**.
2. **Economic interoperability**
* Uses a **public cryptocurrency (MANA)**.
* MANA integrates with:
  * DeFi protocols
  * Exchanges
  * External payment and custody tools
* Users can move value **in and out freely** without platform permission.
3. **Identity interoperability**
* Identity is tied to **blockchain wallets**, not Decentraland accounts.
* The same wallet can represent the user across:
  * Other Web3 metaverses
  * DAO governance platforms
  * NFT communities
* Enables “portable reputation” in principle (even if still emerging in practice).
4. **Developer interoperability**
* Open SDKs and APIs
* Experiences can integrate:
  * External Web3 services (Oracles, NFTs, DeFi hooks)
  * Web apps and services via standard web technologies

### Limits

* True cross-world use of assets depends on **other platforms choosing compatibility**.
* Performance, UX, and moderation are harder to standardize across open systems.

**Summary:** Decentraland is interoperable by default at the **asset, value, and identity layers**, even if cross-metaverse experiences are still evolving.

## Interoperability on Closed Metaverse

### Core interoperability model

Horizon Worlds prioritizes **vertical integration** within Meta’s ecosystem rather than openness.

### How it connects with other systems
1. **Asset interoperability**
* Virtual items are **non-transferable outside Meta’s platforms**
* Assets cannot:
  * Be exported
  * Be used in non-Meta virtual worlds
  * Be traded on external marketplaces
* Items are licenses, not owned property
2. **Economic interoperability**
* Uses **proprietary virtual currencies**
* No direct integration with:
  * Cryptocurrencies
  * External payment rails beyond Meta-approved systems
* Value is **trapped inside the platform**
3. **Identity interoperability**
* Identity is tied to a **Meta account**
* Some interoperability exists *within* Meta products (Facebook, Instagram, Quest)
* No portable identity across independent virtual worlds
4. **Developer interoperability**
* Developers must use Meta’s tools and APIs
* External integrations are:
  * Limited
  * Permissioned
  * Subject to policy changes
* No ability to deploy experiences that meaningfully connect Horizon Worlds to open ecosystems

### Limits (by design)

* Meta restricts interoperability to:
  * Maintain control
  * Ensure safety and compliance
  * Protect revenue streams

**Summary:** Horizon Worlds is interoperable **only inside Meta’s walled garden**.

### Direct comparison

| Dimension                 | Decentraland (Open)           | Horizon Worlds (Closed) |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Asset portability         | High (NFTs, external wallets) | None (platform-locked)  |
| Currency interoperability | High (public crypto)          | Very low (proprietary)  |
| Identity portability      | Wallet-based, cross-platform  | Meta account only       |
| External marketplaces     | Yes                           | No                      |
| Cross-metaverse potential | Designed for it               | Explicitly restricted   |
| Control over integrations | Community / open standards    | Meta                    |

Below is a **comparison of user autonomy** between an **open metaverse (Decentraland)** and a **closed metaverse (Meta Horizon Worlds)** focusing on **how much freedom users have to create, interact, and control their experiences**.

## User Autonomy in Open Metaverse

### Freedom to create
* **Permissionless creation**  
  Anyone can build experiences, mint wearables, or develop services without asking a central authority.
* **Tooling flexibility**  
  Users can create with Decentraland’s SDK, standard web technologies, and external Web3 tools.
* **No centralized curation**  
  There is no “app approval” process comparable to an app store.
**Implication**  
  Creativity is limited mainly by technical skill and market demand, not by platform permission.

### Freedom to interact
* **Open social spaces**  
  Users can organize events, communities, and economies independently.
* **Custom rules**  
  Landowners can define interaction rules within their parcels (games, access control, monetization).
* **Cross-ecosystem interaction**  
  Users interact via wallets that also function in other Web3 ecosystems.

**Implication:** Social and economic interactions are **user-defined**, not centrally scripted.

### Control over assets and identity
* **True ownership**  
  Users own LAND, wearables, and tokens via their wallets.
* **Portability**  
  Assets and identity exist independently of Decentraland and can persist even if the platform changes.
* **Exit rights**  
  Users can leave the platform while retaining assets and value.

**Implication:** Users have **sovereignty**—the platform cannot easily revoke or alter ownership.

### Constraints on autonomy

* Technical complexity
* Market risk and volatility
* Limited content moderation consistency

**Summary:** Decentraland maximizes autonomy, even at the cost of UX simplicity and centralized safeguards.


## User Autonomy in Closed Metaverse

### Freedom to create
* **Permissioned creation**  
  Users can create worlds and items only using Meta-approved tools.
* **Platform rules**  
  Content must comply with Meta’s policies, formats, and monetization rules.
* **No code-level freedom**  
  Deep customization or external integrations are restricted.

**Implication:** Creation is easier, but tightly bounded by platform design.

### Freedom to interact
* **Curated social environments**  
  Interactions are shaped by Meta’s safety systems and moderation tools.
* **Restricted experimentation**  
  Certain social, economic, or governance experiments are disallowed.
* **No external interoperability**  
  Interactions remain inside Meta’s ecosystem.

**Implication:** Interaction freedom is **managed**, prioritizing safety and predictability.

### Control over assets and identity

* **No true ownership**  
  Virtual items are licenses tied to a Meta account.
* **Revocability**  
  Access to content or assets can be suspended or removed by Meta.
* **Identity lock-in**  
  Identity is not portable outside Meta platforms.

**Implication:** Users are participants, not sovereign owners.

### Benefits of reduced autonomy

* Lower technical barrier
* More consistent moderation
* More predictable user experience

**Summary:** Horizon Worlds optimizes for accessibility and safety, sacrificing user control and independence.


### Direct comparison

| Dimension         | Decentraland (Open)    | Horizon Worlds (Closed) |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Creation freedom  | Permissionless         | Platform-approved       |
| Interaction rules | User-defined           | Platform-defined        |
| Asset ownership   | User-owned (NFTs)      | Licensed, revocable     |
| Identity control  | Wallet-based, portable | Meta account            |
| Ability to exit   | Keep assets & identity | Lose access/value       |
| Platform control  | Minimal                | Extensive               |

## Conclusion

Across governance, economic models, interoperability, and user autonomy, a clear divide emerges between open and closed metaverses.

**Open metaverses like Decentraland** emphasize decentralization, user ownership, and interoperability, giving participants significant control and economic upside but also exposing them to complexity and risk.  
**Closed metaverses like Meta Horizon Worlds** prioritize centralized control, ease of use, and safety, offering more predictable experiences at the cost of limited ownership, interoperability, and autonomy.

Ultimately, the choice between these models reflects a trade-off between **sovereignty and openness** versus **convenience and control**, shaping how power, value, and creativity are distributed in the metaverse.
