The desire for perfectionism is characterized by a constant pursuit of excellence, often accompanied
by perpetual dissatisfaction with one's achievements[^1]. This personality trait can be both a
driver of success and a source of distress, depending on its form[^1].

Perfectionism can be divided into three main types: self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially
prescribed[^2]. Self-oriented perfectionism involves setting extremely high standards for oneself,
while other-oriented perfectionism refers to demanding perfection from others. Socially prescribed
perfectionism reflects the belief that others expect one to be perfect[^2].

Perfectionist concerns—such as excessive worry about making mistakes or failing to meet high
standards—are more strongly linked to symptoms of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
depression[^4]. Research indicates that these concerns can be a risk factor for the development of
psychopathology in young people[^4].

Perfectionism can also have negative consequences on mental health, including increased risks of
anxiety, depression, and burnout[^2]. It may also impair interpersonal relationships, as
perfectionists often impose the same high expectations on others that they impose on themselves[^1].

Ultimately, the desire for perfection can become a trap, leading to an overemphasis on performance,
pride in self-control, or rigid moralism[^3]. Therefore, it is important to recognize the limits of
perfectionism and understand when it becomes counterproductive[^1].
